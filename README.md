###***Game Logic***

We are going to play Rock, Paper, and Scissors. These elements are in a circular relationship.

Rock beats Scissors

Scissors beats Paper

Paper beats Rock


1. Once the game is opened, it will show how the game works (circular relationship) and provide player to choose between three options (Rock, Paper, Scissors). Could have player to type R/r = Rock, P/p = Paper, S/s = Scissors

2. Once the player have chosen, the computer/AI player randomly chooses between the three options

3. System checks both player's choices and checks who has won the round.

4. Now the result is displayed to the player either they have won,lost, or tied with what they have chosen and the AI have chosen.

5. It will ask the player if they want to play again by typing y/n.

6. If user has types y, it goes back to step 1. if user has typed n, it prompts short good-bye display.
